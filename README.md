A console based manga reader which lets you read manga on desktops.

It is made using Python and C++. It includes libraries like SFML and Beautiful Soup.

You can edit the app however you want just don't say that it's is yours.

Controls:

+ - Auto Scroll Speed Up

- - Auto Scroll Speed Down

Enter - Enable/Disable Auto Scroll

ESC - Exit App

Things to note are that pressing enter at any time just takes you back to the initial 3 options. Also the size of the window depends on the size of the image divided by 2. If this is an issue I could provide a quick update for the viewer and add a config file to the folder so it could be modified to be any size.
